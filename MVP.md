So for Imperfect Produce to grow in 2021, I see their mission as a two prong approach.

1) Enter New Markets

Below are the markets Imperfect is not currently operating in blue and markets they've just begun to enter in the last few months in orange. Most of the markets in orange will be not included in where to grow as their major metropolitan areas have already started service (with the exception of Tennnessee currnetly only in Nashville).

Florida not surprisingly has population and good population density along with Georgia.  We are factoring in density (people per square mile) to accomplish the third goal of Imperfect Foods which is to be a sustainable company and lower its carbon footprint while also being efficient to impact the maximum number of people.

The Next step is to take the 7 or 8 states we finalize on and investigate counties where we can make the most impact, where the highest population are and the most food deserts.  We will also look at the SNAP benefit participation in the particular counties to see how this layer correlates with food deserts. 


2) Work on building our current markets

This analysis we will likely include in the future work/appendix, but look at Google Trends to see how we are trending with the public versus our competitor Misfits Market.  

If there is time we will also use Facebook mobility data to infer which area of the countries are moving around less and therefore may be more open to grocery delivery.
