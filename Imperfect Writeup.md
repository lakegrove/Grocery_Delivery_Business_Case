## Abstract

The goal of this project was to recommend markets for Imperfect Produce to enter in 2021 to expand its business after a record year in 2020.  The analysis targeted using US Census, USDA and SNAP data to identify target counties and states that satisfy growing revenue and social impact.  I grouped income, food deserts, population density and SNAP benefit population to form my criteria for market selection. To explore the data, I built visuals in Tableau and excel, assembling an analysis with recommendations of entering the Southeast market, particularly the state of Florida. 

## Design
This project originated from a place of passion.  Obesity is one of the leading causes of healthy issues in America and that is often due to the economics and options available to lower income individuals.  The data is a mix of US Census income and population data, USDA food desert designations from 2017, SNAP retailer locations and US Consumer spending data from 2020. 

This data assembled gave target counties that have a good distribution a large population with high income along with higher numbers of food deserts and/or SNAP benefit population.  This density of the two types of customers helps Imperfect Produce’s other mission of reducing its carbon footprint by being efficient in serving its many customers. 

There is also a small piece of analysis on tracking Imperfect Produce’s market presence over the last year versus its competitor Misfits Market utilizing Google Trends
