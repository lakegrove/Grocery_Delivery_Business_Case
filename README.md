# Grocery Delivery Business Case

Since the beginning of Covid one year ago, there has been a massive shift into grocery delievery as less people are able or comfortable to go out to get their own groceries.  With this development, a fantastic opportunity has spung up for delivery services to fill the need of the market. Imperfect Produce is a grocery delivery service that delivers high quality food that isn't accepted by many conventional grocery stores due to the appearance of the food.  Imperfect produce buys this food and sells custom delivered boxes of food as part of a subscription services at a discount to what can be found at most grocery stores.  They are able to sell this food at a discount due to the nature of alternatives with this food either going to waste or being donated.  This helps customers source high quality food for a bargin price, while helping Imperfect Foods bottom line and objectives of reducing food waste and helping the environment.   

Imperfect Foods also offers 33% off its service to people elgible for SNAP benefits in an effort to help low income people eat well as often the affordiability and availability of high quality food prevents certain populations from eating a healthy diet.  It is esimated that nearly 25 million people in the United States are in food deserts with more than half of them being low income. 

Currently Imperfect Foods reports roughly 350,000 customer so there is a huge opportunity to grow their business both in their main segment as well as helping out people in low income and food desert communities. 

The goal of this analysis is to highlight areas where Imperfect Foods should direct their marketing efforts to aquire new customers on both ends of the spectrum.  As we are still in the middle of the pandemic this effort will help them keep people safe in the short term, but also hopefully gain long term customers. By identifying areas where people are traveling less we can get an idea of which areas of the country would be most likely to desire groceries delievered due to health concerns and we can use this by using Facebook's data on people movement since the beginning of the pandemic.  We can overlay this analysis for the food deserts as identified by the US Census (2017) to get an idea of where Imperfect Produce can target people that are not near a grocery store as well as recent SNAP benefit data to help people who are struggling financially due to the pandemic.

## Question/need:

Where should Imperfect Product target its marketing efforts to grow its customers for both tiers of the services it offers?
