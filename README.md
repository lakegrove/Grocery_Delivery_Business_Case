# Grocery Delivery Business Case

Since the beginning of Covid one year ago, there has been a massive shift into grocery delievery and this has provided a fantastic opportunity for companies like Imperfect Produce, an online grocery retailer.  Imperfect delivers high quality food that isn't accepted by many conventional grocery stores due to the appearance of the food.  This allows Imperfect to sell custom delivered boxes of food as part of a subscription services at a discount to what can be found at most grocery stores.  Their service helps customers source high quality food for a bargin price, while helping Imperfect Foods bottom line and mission towards reducing food waste and helping the environment.   

Imperfect Foods also offers 33% off its service to people elgible for SNAP benefits in an effort to help low income people eat well as often the affordiability and availability of high quality food prevents certain populations from eating a healthy diet.  In 2010, it was esimated that nearly 25 million people in the United States are in food deserts with low access to grocery stores.

Currently Imperfect Foods reports roughly 350,000 customer so there is a huge opportunity to grow their business both in their main segment as well as helping out people in low income and food desert communities. 

The goal of this analysis is to highlight markets where Imperfect Foods should look to grow its business in 2021.   As we are still in the middle of the pandemic this effort will help them keep people safe in the short term, but also hopefully gain long term customers. By identifying areas where we have high population, with a good distribution of customers from all income levels, we can maximize Imperfect's customer growth.  We will use census data to get an idea of county demographics and utilize food desert and SNAP statistics to figure out where the customers reside that are most in need.

## Question/need:

## What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?

Using tableau and excel to highlight the states and counties that make the most sense to expand into.  I will be looking for high population, decent median income, SNAP eligiblility, food deserts and population density as factor for looking for counties to target
